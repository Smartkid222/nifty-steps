                            Every child is entitled to respect for the dignity of his person, and accordingly, no child shall be <br>
                            
                            (a) subjected to physical, mental or emotional injury, abuse, neglect or maltreatment, including sexual abuse; or <br>

                            The school therefore has the duty to protect the children under its care vis-à-vis its own right under the constitution
                            to fulfill its mission of providing education in a peaceful and orderly environment. To this end, students, teachers and
                            employees, including contractors working for and on behalf of the school shall adhere to the following policies.

                    <section class="about-text">
                        <p>
                            We recognize at Nifty Steps School that all persons in the school environment, irrespective of their age, race, gender,
                            whether they live with disabilities or not, bring with them their uniqueness and differing perspectives on life. The
                            school embraces the differences and peculiarities in the schoolhouse because diversity transforms the learning place
                            into a center of great ideas and innovativeness. The collective and personal knowledge database in the school place
                            improves because of the different experiences that everyone brings to the schoolhouse. <br>
                            
                            The overarching policy of Nifty Steps School is that everyone within the school environment must recognize that people
                            differ in appearance, intellect, race, faith, their worldviews, and personal preferences. The differences
                            notwithstanding, all peoples share the same humanness, as well as jointly occupy the earth in mutual existence. To this
                            end, this set of policies mandates every student and school employee to adhere to the following: <br>
                        </p>
                    </section>

                    <span>

                        life. <br>
                        -> Not let the age, gender, perceived power, and status or personality of people that they interact with become a
                        hindrance
                        to the core value of respect for every person. <br>
                        -> Accept the persons of all peoples, whether they be students, teachers, parents or other school employees. <br>
                        -> Accept that people have their opinions and that they must respect those views even if they do not agree with them.
                        <br>
                        -> Accept the perceived flaws, disabilities, and other shortcomings in people as part of the uniqueness that they bring
                        to
                        everyday experience and knowledge acquisition.

                    <section class="about-text">
                        <p>
                            A. Bullying - Bullying is the use of a person’s mental advantage, superior strength, or knowledge power to influence or
                            intimidate
                            others. Bullying can be corporal or in the form of verbal assaults, such as name-calling, teasing, graphics and written
                            expressions that are intended to ridicule a person. The effects of bullying can be so traumatic as to cause its victim
                            to wish never to go back to school or the location where the bullying occurs. Under such a condition the victim can be
                            considered being denied his or her right to a free, compulsory and universal basic education as enshrined in the
                            constitution, as well as federal and state Child Rights laws. <br>
                            <br>
                            It is a violation of the policy of Nifty Steps School for any student, teacher, or other school employees to bully any
                            student or other members of the school community based on disability or for any reason whatsoever. <br>
                            <br>
                            It is also a violation of this policy for any teacher, or other employees of the school to tolerate or hide the act of
                            bullying of a student or school employee by a student, teacher or another school employee. This policy also applies to
                            third parties who may be contractors or participants in activities organized by Nifty Steps School.<br>
                            <br>
                            B. Harassment - Harassment has similar effects on its victims as bullying does. Bullying and Harassment create an unsafe
                            school
                            environment and are harmful to their victims and the social context in which they occur. <br>
                            <br>
                            The Oxford dictionary defines harassment as verbally or physically disturbing, forcing, intimidating, badgering,
                            annoying, coercing, irritating or molesting a person. It could be an unwanted one-off or repeated action which often
                            adversely affects the victim’s ability to concentrate or continue to participate in school activities. <br>
                            <br>
                            All acts of harassment violate the policy of Nifty Steps School. It is a violation of school policy for a student,
                            teacher or school employee to harass anyone on the bases of that person’s physique, gender, race, assumed intellectual
                            ability, disability or for any other reason. School employees in this context mean teaching and non-teaching employees,
                            including gardeners, cleaners, and security officers employed by the school. For this policy, the following conducts
                            constitute Harassment: <br>
                            <br>
                            -> Any cartoon or art form containing offensive language <br>
                            -> name calling or jokes about a person’s looks or disability <br>
                            -> threats directed at someone of inferior strength <br>
                            -> written or graphic hate material aimed at degrading a person <br>
                            -> aggressive conduct such as theft or damage to property which is motivated by hate. <br>
                            <br>
                            C. Sexual Harassment - Sexual harassment is a violation of Nifty Steps School policy. We define sexual harassment in
                            this context as unwanted
                            sexual overtures or demands for sexual favors either in exchange for pass grades or other favors. It also involves oral
                            and bodily conduct or gestures of a sexual connotation. The following actions, which all amount to sexual harassment,
                            are violations of the Nifty Steps School policy: <br>
                            <br>
                            -> sexual overtures <br>
                            -> ouching, patting, grabbing or pinching another person’s intimate parts <br>
                            -> forcing or attempting to force the touching of anyone’s intimate parts <br>
                            -> attempting to compel or force sexual intercourse <br>
                            -> sexual gesticulations <br>
                            -> sexual or dirty jokes <br>
                            -> touching oneself sexually in front of others <br>
                            -> talking or boasting about one’s sexual performance <br>
                        </p>
                    </section>

                    <p class="hero-subtitle">PART II – ACADEMIC TRANSPARENCY POLICY</p> <br>

                    <section class="about-text">
                        <p>
                            Achievement of educational excellence comes in a culture of assiduousness and academic transparency. Plagiarism and
                            examination fraud are a serious crime and children must be taught the values of owning the work they present as their
                            own. <br>
                            <br>
                            It is Nifty Steps School’s policy that teachers in the school be examples of academic honesty and that the children are
                            well supervised to embrace hard work and transparency in their academics. To this end, parents must collaborate with
                            teachers to ensure that: <br>
                            <br>
                            the students understand early in life the concept of plagiarism and the life outcomes of academic dishonesty.
                            all class tasks and homework submitted by the student are truly his or her work.
                            the child understands how to appropriately credit all sources of materials used in his or her work.
                            That said, any student or teacher who plagiarizes or cheats on tests or external examinations violates the Nifty Steps
                            School Academic Transparency Policy. A teacher, school employee, or student who aids, condone or covers an act of

                        <p>
                            Any student or school employee who thinks that he or she is a victim of any violation of these policies should report to
                            the school administrator, principal or senior tutor in the school. A teacher who receives such complaint should forward
                            it to the Administrator who will in turn forward the report to the School Policy Complaint Board for investigation. The
                            board shall appoint a three-person investigation committee which shall include the principal of the affected branch of
                            the school, to investigate the alleged violation. Where the building principal is the alleged accused, any other teacher
                            in the school can be appointed into the investigation panel. <br>
                            <br>
                            The panels shall sit for two weeks, within which they must conclude their investigations and turn in their reports to
                            the School Policy Complaint Board.
